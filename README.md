# ufuzzyconvert

ufuzzyconvert is a tool for converting FIS files used by MATLAB to CFS format,
a lightweight binary format used by
[ÂµFuzzy](http://bitbucket.org/fsalinasmendoza/fuzzy).

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your
local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

ufuzzyconvert requires Ruby and was tested against Ruby 2.1.5. On Windows
machines, Ruby can be installed using
[RubyInstaller](https://rubyinstaller.org/downloads/). On Linux machines, it can
be installed using a package management system such as apt:

gem install simplecov
```

To build documentation, yard must be installed:

```

```
git clone https://github.com/fsalinasmendoza/ufuzzyconvert.git
```

### Running the converter

FIS files can be converted running:

```
bin/ufuzzyconvert <file.fis>
```

Its should output the file 'output.cfs'.

## Running the tests
